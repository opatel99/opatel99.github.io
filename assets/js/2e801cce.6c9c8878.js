Each time I start, I write a quick intro blurb and never post again. This time, I\'ll be trying to be more diligent and thematic in what I write.\\n\\n## Intent\\nThe focus of this blog will mostly be around\\n1. Computer science / Tech\\n2. Math\\n3. Finance\\n4. Working and productivity\\n5. Other random rabbit holes I dive into\\n\\n:::tip\\nI\'d also love to collaborate on any posts that fit the bill, so if you feel that\'s something you\'d enjoy doing, don\'t hesitate to let me know.\\n:::\\n\\n## Thanks \ud83e\udd17\\nI appreciate you making it this far! Hopefully you\'ll enjoy my future posts, but for now, try out the daily Wordle.\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://mikhad.github.io/wordle/#daily\\" style={{width:300, height:600, border:\'none\'}} frameborder=\\"0\\" scrolling=\\"no\\"></iframe>"}]}')}}]);

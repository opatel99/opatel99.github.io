Hey! I'm Ohm üêß! I'm a 24-year-old software engineer working remotely from Memphis, TN.

<!--truncate-->

## Why
I've been interested in blogging for a long time and have probably set up four of these sites since middle school. Each time I start, I write a quick intro blurb and never post again. This time, I'll be trying to be more diligent and thematic in what I write.

## Intent
The focus of this blog will mostly be around
1. Computer science / Tech
2. Math
3. Finance
4. Working and productivity
5. Other random rabbit holes I dive into

:::tip
I'd also love to collaborate on any posts that fit the bill, so if you feel that's something you'd enjoy doing, don't hesitate to let me know.

## Thanks ü§ó
I appreciate you making it this far! Hopefully you'll enjoy my future posts, but for now, take your chance at a 2048 throwback.
